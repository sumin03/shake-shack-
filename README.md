## The reason I tried to change this website.

### 📍http://www.shakeshack.kr
> This is original Shake-shack website 

When I open the website, It feels like I'm looking into a **blog** not a **company website**
So I tried to keep **Original shake-shack website vibe** but by changing the layout, banners, and font-family. 
I wanted to give a professional vibe on there. 



 ## I tried to change like this. 

1. Changing whole layout to give a professional vibe on the website. 

2. Trying to highlight their food & beverage by making the section wider 

3. Even though they're doing events those things, but they do not post on their website. So customer hard to know it is exist or not, So I made banner on the bottom of the main page to highlight 


4. For making it user-friendly, I made 'TOP' button for users that they do not have to scroll all the way back to the top 



## What I change in code

As you can see, The **original website** just look like a blog not a **company website** 
So I changed the layout. 
Before, I only know **float element** so I tried to changed **html & css** code to use **flex-box** 
And Also There doesn't have any interesting elements to highlight their products. 
So In the **FOOD & DRINK** page, I gave an animation and burger text-layout. 




#### Changed css code 

I didn't know using **':root'** element before so wrote every element values by myself, even though I kept writing same values. 
So After studying **':root'** element so I changed it like this

And I also didn't know about **flex-box** at that moment. So I tried to changed some part ( using with float ) with **flex-box**

first, I changed html to use **flex-box**

This is css with **flex-box**

2. I made **'top button**. As one of a website user, I sometimes found out the annoyed part when website do not offer 'back to top' button. 
So I put it in for users.

3. In **Food & DRINK** page, I gave an animation on the banner to emphasize their product. Plus, I even made burger layout on the Burger introduce phrases to give more impression that They are looking at the burger website.

4. Even though They also do some events but do not announce on the website. So people barely know that they are doing it. 
So I made banner by myself and put on the bottom of the main page.
